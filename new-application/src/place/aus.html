        <h2>Great Barrier Reerf</h2>
        <pre><p>
        <br>
The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system,[1][2] composed of 
over 2,900 individual reefs[3] and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometres (1,400 mi) 
over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000 sq mi).[4][5] 
The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, separated from 
the coast by a channel 100 miles wide in places and over 200 feet deep.[6] The Great Barrier Reef
can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms.
This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral 
polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981.
CNN labelled it one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World in 1997.[9] Australian World 
Heritage places included it in its list in 2007.[10] The Queensland National Trust named it a 
state icon of Queensland in 2006.[11]

A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit
the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and 
its ecosystem include runoff of manmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral 
bleaching,dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish.
According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, a finding reaffirmed by a 2020 study 
which found over half of the reef's coral cover to have been lost between 1995 and 2017, with 
the effects of a widespread 2020 bleaching event not yet quantified.
