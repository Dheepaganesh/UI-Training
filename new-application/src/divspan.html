        <h1>Pollution</h1>
        <pre><p id="main">Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.
Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light).
Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.
Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants 
have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, 
poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated 
specific site, such as a factory or mine) or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as 
microplastics or agricultural runoff).Many sources of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during the 19th and 
20th centuries until the emergence of environmental regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th century.
Sites where historically polluting industries released persistent pollutants may have legacy pollution long after the source of 
the pollution is stopped. Major forms of pollution include air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution
, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.</p></pre>

            <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
            <pre><p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.
Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, 
carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide.Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. WHO data show 
that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.
Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to 
reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term 
mitigation of climate change.<br></p>

            <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
            <pre>
            <p>Water pollutants may cause disease or act as poisons.Bacteria and parasites in poorly treated sewage may enter drinking water supplies and cause digestive problems such as cholera and diarrhea.
Hazardous chemicals, pesticides, and herbicides from industries, farms, homes and golf courses can cause acute toxicity and immediate death, or chronic toxicity that can lead to neurological problems or cancers.
Many water pollutants enter our bodies when we use water for drinking and food preparation. The pollutants enter the digestive tract. From there, they can reach other organs in the body and cause various illnesses. 
Chemicals come in contact with the skin from washing clothes, or from swimming in polluted water and may lead to skin irritations. Hazardous chemicals in water systems can also affect the animals and plants which live there. 
Sometimes these organisms will survive with the chemicals in their systems, only to be eaten by humans who may then become mildly ill or develop stronger toxic symptoms. The animals and plants themselves may die or not reproduce properly.</p>

            <h2>Soil Pollution</h2>
            <pre>
            <p>Soil pollution is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in the soil, in very high concentrations to pose a risk to human health and the ecosystem.
Or in simple words Alteration in the natural soil due to human activities is termed Soil Pollution.For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene can increase the risk of
soil pollution diseases like contracting leukemia.All the soils contain compounds that are harmful to human beings and other living organisms. However, the concentration of such substances in 
unpolluted soil is so low that they do not pose any threat to the surroundings but when the concentration of such toxic substances becomes high enough to cause damage to living organisms, the soil is said to be contaminated.

            <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
            <pre>
            <p>Noise pollution, or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise or sound with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of which are harmful to a degree.
The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and propagation systems.
Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas.
Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, wind turbines, explosions and people.
Documented problems associated with noise in urban environments go back as far as ancient Rome.</p>
